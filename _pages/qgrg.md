title: "Quantum Gravity and the Renormalization Group workshops"
classes: wide
---

This workshop series, organized roughly every two years by a varying set of organisers brings together several distinct approaches to quantum gravity under the common theme of Renormalization Group concepts and tools.
**The Renormalization Group may provide a common vantage point from which the landscape of distinct approaches can be surveyed** and the relation of various approaches to each other understood. Such a vantage point could become a catalyst for breakthroughs: While each individual approach to quantum gravity faces open questions and challenges, many insights obtained in distinct approaches are in fact complementary. Thus the development of a common language like the Renormalization Group and the **associated unified conceptual framework** holds the promise that insights could be translated between approaches. 
 
In addition, the connection between microphysics and macrophysics that is inherent to the Renormalization Group could be key to **connect the microphysics of quantum gravity to phenomenological consequences** and ultimately even observational data at larger scales.
 
This workshop series therefore has two main goals: Firstly, it provides a platform for Renormalization Group tools and techniques in quantum gravity, with the clear goal to establish a constructive dialogue between different approaches. Secondly, it focuses on the connection of quantum gravity approaches to their phenomenological imprints that can be achieved through Renormalization Group techniques.
