title: "10+ years of Asymptotic Safety Seminars"
classes: wide
---

The international seminar on asymptotic safety was founded in spring 2011, with the intention of bringing the asymptotic-safety community together, and providing a platform for talks on asymptotic safety in and beyond quantum gravity, as well as related topics in quantum gravity and quantum field theory.

The seminars take place Mondays at 4pm Central European Time (beware of European daylight saving) on [zoom](https://zoom.us/) and are announced via a mailing list. After each seminar, informal conversation and community exchange take place in a virtual [gather-town](https://gather.town/) environment. A [slack](https://slack.com) space offers the opportunity for asynchronous discussion of recent advances in the field.

If you are interested in attending the seminars and joining the community, please contact [Aaron Held](mailto:a.held@imperial.ac.uk) or [Marc Schiffer](mailto:schiffer@thphys.uni-heidelberg.de) to join the corresponding mailing list.
