title: "Tim Morris: Ultraviolet finite resummation of perturbative quantum gravity"

If the metric is chosen to depend exponentially on the conformal factor, and if one works in a gauge where the conformal factor has the wrong sign propagator, perturbative quantum gravity corrections can be partially resummed into a series of terms each of which is ultraviolet finite. These new terms however are not perturbative in some small parameter, and are not individually BRST invariant, or background diffeomorphism invariant. 
With appropriate parametrisation, the finiteness property holds true also for a full phenomenologically relevant theory of quantum gravity coupled to (beyond the standard model) matter fields, provided massive tadpole corrections are set to zero by a trivial renormalisation.
