title: "Tim Morris: Trace anomaly and infrared cutoffs"
---

The Effective Average Action is a form of effective action which depends on a cutoff scale suppressing the contribution of low momentum modes in the functional integral. It reduces to the ordinary effective action when the cutoff scale goes to zero. We derive the modifications of the scale Ward identity due to this cutoff and show how the resulting identity then intimately relates the trace anomaly to the Wilsonian realisation of the renormalization group.
