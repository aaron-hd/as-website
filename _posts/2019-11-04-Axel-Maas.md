title: "Axel Maas: The Fröhlich-Morcchio-Strocchi Mechanism and Quantum Gravity"
---

Taking manifest invariance under both gauge symmetry and diffeomorphisms as a guiding principle physical objects are constructed for Yang-Mills-Higgs theory coupled to quantum gravity. These objects are entirely classified by quantum numbers defined in the tangent space. The so-called Fröhlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism allows to determine the properties of these objects under certain circumstances, and especially shows how conventional quantum field theory in flat space emerges as the leading term in a systematic expansion. Taking these results literally exhibits how quantum gravity fields need to dress particle physics quantum fields to create physical objects, i.e. giving a graviton component to ordinary observed particles.
