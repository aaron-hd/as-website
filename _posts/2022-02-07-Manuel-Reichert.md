title: "Manuel Reichert: Lorentzian quantum gravity and the graviton spectral function"
---

We present the first direct and non-perturbative computation of the graviton spectral function in quantum gravity. This is achieved with the help of a novel Lorentzian renormalisation group approach, combined with a spectral representation of correlation functions. We find a positive graviton spectral function, showing a massless one-graviton peak and a multi-graviton continuum with an asymptotically safe scaling for large spectral values. We also study the impact of a cosmological constant. Further steps to investigate scattering processes and unitarity in asymptotically safe quantum gravity are indicated.
