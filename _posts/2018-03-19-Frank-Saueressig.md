title: "Frank Saueressig: Asymptotically safe f(R)-gravity coupled to matter"
---

We use the functional renormalization group equation for the effective average action to study the non-Gaussian renormalization group fixed points (NGFPs) arising within the framework of f(R)-gravity minimally coupled to an arbitrary number of scalar, Dirac, and vector fields. The setting provides new estimates on which gravity-matter systems give rise to NGFPs suitable for Asymptotic Safety. The relation between the choice of coarse graining operator and the properties of the NGFPs will be discussed in detail. We will also briefly comment on possible extensions of the polynomial fixed point solutions to full fixed functionals.
