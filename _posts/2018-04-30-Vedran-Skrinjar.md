title: "Vedran Skrinjar: Safe and free instantons"
---

We will discuss the instanton dynamics of asymptotically safe and free quantum field theories featuring respectively controllable ultraviolet and infrared fixed points. We'll start with a lightning review of the salient points about the instanton calculus for pure Yang Mills and QCD. After that we'll move on to determine the role of instantons within the controllable regime of the QCD conformal window and the asymptotically safe Litim-Sannino model. The presentation is based on 1802.10372.
