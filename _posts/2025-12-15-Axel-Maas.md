Geons are hypothetical objects from self-bound gravity quanta. They are potential candidates for dark matter, but could also be considered (quantum) black holes, and could be actually be constituents of macroscopical black holes.

In this talk we will report on first, exploratory investigations of geons using causal dynamical triangulation simulations. We indeed find some hints towards a particle-like structure, which can be boldly interpreted as geons. We find also evidence which hint that such objects may be accessible in other methods, exploiting the presence of a Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism in quantum gravity, which is supported by the causal dynamical triangulation simulations themselves.
