title: "Benjamin Knorr: Momentum-dependent field redefinitions in Asymptotic Safety"
published: "true"

We discuss general momentum-dependent field redefinitions in the context of quantum-gravitational scattering amplitudes in general, and Asymptotic Safety in particular. Implementing such redefinitions at the lowest curvature order, we can bring the graviton propagator into tree-level form, avoiding issues of fiducial ghost poles and their associated violations of unitarity. We compute the beta function for Newton's constant, and find an asymptotically safe fixed point whose critical exponent changes by 0.4\% compared to not resolving the momentum-dependent field redefinition. This provides a strong indication that this fixed point does not feature extra degrees of freedom related to ghostly modes, and has a good chance of being related to a unitary theory.
