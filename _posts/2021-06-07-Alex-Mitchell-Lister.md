title: "Alex Mitchell-Lister: A continuum limit of quantum gravity at second order in perturbation theory"
---

In this talk we discuss the most recent step in an approach to finding the continuum limit of quantum gravity using the exact renormalization group and the conformal instability of general relativity. We outline the broad structure behind a novel operator which acts as a portal for this new approach and the implementation of diffeomorphism invariance in an equally novel way. We then discuss results at second order in perturbation theory, outstanding problems and their possible resolution.
