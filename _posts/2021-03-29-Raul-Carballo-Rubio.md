title: "Raúl Carballo Rubio: Mass inflation and the semiclassical limit of quantum black holes"
---

Geometries describing static non-singular black holes have been obtained in suitable limits of various quantum gravity frameworks, including asymptotic safety. After a brief review of the underlying geometric reasons behind this universality, and a discussion of the similarities between these geometries and classical charged/rotating black holes, the talk will focus on the description of mass inflation in this extended setting. The presentation will be pedagogical, with emphasis on the assumptions, implications, and limitations of existing studies.
