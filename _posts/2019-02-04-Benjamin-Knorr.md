title: "Benjamin Knorr: RG flow with a covariant foliation"
---

After a short introduction on how to set up a foliation in a covariant language, I will use this formalism to investigate the RG flow on foliated spacetimes. In particular, I will report on the flow of some Lorentz breaking couplings relevant in the discussion of Horava-Lifshitz gravity.
