title: "Martin Pauly: Safety in Darkness: Towards asymptotically safe dark matter models"
---

Asymptotic safety might have significant predictive implications for dark matter models. I illustrate this in a toy model for the visible Higgs-Yukawa sector of the Standard Model, coupled to a dark sector through a portal coupling. This model provides a very first example for a model that i) could feature a fixed point at finite portal coupling, ii) might predict the value of all interactions in the matter sector. The second property might give rise to calculable relations between the masses of the dark particles, their self-interactions, and the portal coupling. The talk is based on arxiv:2005.03661.
