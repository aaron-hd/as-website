In gauge-Yukawa systems embedded in the framework of trans-Planckian asymptotic safety we discuss the dynamical generation of arbitrarily small Yukawa couplings driven by the presence of a non-interactive infrared-attractive fixed point in the renormalization group flow. Additional ultraviolet-attractive fixed points guarantee that the theory remains well defined up to an infinitely high scale. We apply this mechanism to the Yukawa couplings of the Standard Model extended with right-handed neutrinos, finding that asymptotically safe solutions in agreement with the current experimental determination of the masses and mixing angles exist for Dirac neutrinos with normal mass ordering. We finally extend the discussion to generic new physics models with feeble Yukawa interactions.
