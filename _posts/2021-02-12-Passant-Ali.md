title: "Passant Ali: Constraints on discrete global symmetries in quantum gravity"
---

The question whether global symmetries can be realized in quantum-gravity-matter-systems has far-reaching phenomenological consequences. During my talk I will discuss evidence we found that within an asymptotically safe context, discrete global symmetries of the form Z_n,n >4, cannot be realized in a near-perturbative regime. In contrast, an effective-field-theory approach to quantum gravity might feature such symmetries, providing a mechanism to generate mass hierarchies in the infrared, without the need for additional fine-tuning.
