title: "Ivano Basile: String Tension between de Sitter vacua and Curvature Corrections"
---

Higher-derivative corrections to cosmological effective actions in string theory are largely constrained by T-duality, but have been computed hitherto only to the first few orders in the string scale *α*′. The functional renormalization group, in conjunction with the strong constraints imposed by T-duality, allows to derive cosmological effective actions to all orders in *α*′ while avoiding "truncations" of the theory space. We show that the resulting higher-derivative *α*′-corrections forbid the existence of de Sitter vacua, at least in regimes where string-loop corrections can be neglected. Our findings thus support the implications of the no-de Sitter swampland conjecture in the presence of all-order effects in *α*′.
