We consider a free scalar field on Euclidean dynamical triangulations.  By studying the 1-particle and 2-particle correlation functions, we extract the binding energy between two scalar particles. We extrapolate our data for the binding energy to the continuum, infinite volume limit, and find a result consistent with the expected power-law behavior of the binding energy in four-dimensional space-time. We also report on an estimate for Newton's gravitational coupling, G.
