title: "Senarath de Alwis: Exact RG equations, Quantum Gravity and Ghosts"
---

I derive an exact RG equation for the Wilsonian Effective Action, that is essentially a background field (and gauge invariant) version of the Polchinski equation and apply it to a discussion of quantum gravity. I also argue that the putative (perturbative) ghosts  are spurious if the Asymptotic Safety conjecture is correct. Finally I compare this program to string theory.
