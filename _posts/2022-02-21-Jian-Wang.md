In this work we use the Wetterich equation for the effective average action to investigate the RG flow of gravity supplemented by a real scalar field. We give a non-perturbative proof that the subspace of interactions respecting the global shift-symmetry of the scalar kinetic term is closed under RG transformations. Subsequently, we compute the beta functions in an approximation comprising the Einstein-Hilbert action supplemented by the shift-symmetric quartic scalar self-interaction and the two lowest order shift-symmetric interactions coupling scalar-bilinears to the spacetime curvature. The computation utilizes the background field method with an arbitrary background, demonstrating that the results are manifestly background independent. Our beta functions exhibit an interacting fixed point suitable for Asymptotic Safety, where all matter interactions are non-vanishing. We will also discuss the relation of our findings with previous results in the literature.
