title: "Maximiliano Binder: Functional Renormalization Group Flow of Massive Gravity"
---

We apply the functional renormalization group  equation to a massive Fierz–Pauli action in curved space and  find that, even though a massive term is a modification in  the infrared sector, the mass term modifies the value of the  non-gaussian fixed point in the UV sector. We obtained the  beta function for the scale dependent mass parameter and found that the massive Fierz–Pauli case still seems to be an asymptotically safe theory.
