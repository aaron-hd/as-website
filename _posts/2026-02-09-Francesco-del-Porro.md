Computing the gravitational effective action provides a direct route to charting the landscape of admissible black hole spacetimes and their alternatives, collectively called “gravitationally localized objects” (GLOBs). In this talk, I will provide a proof of principle of this idea within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. Focusing on the Einstein-Weyl truncation, I will identify the unique ultraviolet-complete trajectory emanating from the asymptotically safe fixed point and use it to extract the Wilson coefficient of the Weyl-squared term. This allows to chart the corresponding GLOBs in a “phase diagram”, where wormholes dominate and Bachian naked singularities become disfavored. These results illustrate how quantum gravity can constrain effective field theory and the associated set of allowed spacetimes, yielding a rich landscape of beyond-general-relativity solutions rather than a single alternative to classical black holes.
