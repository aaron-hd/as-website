title: "Giulia Gubitosi and Chris Ripken: Consistent early and late time cosmology from the RG flow of gravity"

We explain how the quantum gravity regime associated with Asymptotic Safety may set the initial conditions for a consistent cosmological evolution, from the early-time inflationary epoch to the late-time cosmological constant epoch. The exposition is built on the recent work arXiv:1806.10147.
