title: "Alicia Castro: FRG Approach to the Continuum Limit of Matrix Models of Quantum Gravity with Preferred Foliation"
---

In this talk I will present the analysis of a dually-weighted Matrix Model which implements a preferred foliation in its dual-graph. By using the FRGE, we study the existence of fixed points and its universality class (CDT or Euclidean Matrix Models). We find first evidence that the FGRE is a useful exploratory tool for the investigation of continuum limits of dually-weighted tensor models and thus for the analytic investigation of the existence of the phases found numerically in the CDT and EDT approaches.
