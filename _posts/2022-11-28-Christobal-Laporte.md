Wetterich’s equation provides a powerful tool for investigating the existence and universal properties of renormalization group fixed points exhibiting quantum scale invariance. Motivated by recent works on asymptotically safe scalar-tensor theories, we develop a novel approximation scheme which projects the functional renormalization group equation onto functions of the kinetic term. Applying this projection to scalars and gauge fields, our analysis identifies a new universality class with a very special spectrum of stability coefficients. The implications of our findings in the context of asymptotically safe gravity-matter systems are discussed.
