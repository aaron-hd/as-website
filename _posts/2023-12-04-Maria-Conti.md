The seminar will revolve around the analysis of the conformal sector of Quantum Einstein Gravity with an improvement due to the study of the role of the anomalous dimension ‘eta’, which gets dynamically determined through the employment of the functional proper-time flow equation. In particular, the presence of the anomalous dimension modifies the Background Independence implementation scheme, as the cutoff scales related to the reference and background metrics now differ by a factor depending on eta. From this scheme, not only a single fixed point but a full fixed point line depending on the anomalous dimension is derived for the model, together with a new picture regarding the critical manifold.
