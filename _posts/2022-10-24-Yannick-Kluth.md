We derive new functional renormalisation group flows for quantum gravity, in any dimension. The key new achievement is that the equations apply for any theory of gravity whose underlying Lagrangian \(f(R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma})\) is a function of the Riemann tensor and the inverse metric. The results centrally exploit the benefits of maximally symmetric spaces for the evaluation of operator traces. The framework is highly versatile and offers a wide range of new applications to study quantum gravitational effects in extensions of Einstein gravity. The phase diagram and sample flows for Einstein-Hilbert gravity, Gauss-Bonnet, and selected higher-order theories of gravity are given together with results for fixed points and UV critical surfaces.
