title: "Jan Kwapisz: Asymptotic safety and quantum gravity amplitudes"
---

Application of the Weinberg's conditions of asymptotic safety to amplitudes and not to couplings of the effective action can help to uniquely define the running in the UV and avoid some of the asymptotic safety program problems. The idea is illustrated by the 4-graviton amplitude in string theory and its symmetries.
