Constraining quantum gravity from observations is a challenge. In this seminar, I explore the idea that the interplay of quantum gravity with matter could be key to meeting this challenge. Thus, I set out to confront different potential candidates for quantum gravity — unimodular asymptotic safety, Weyl-squared gravity and asymptotically safe gravity — with constraints arising from demanding an ultraviolet complete Standard Model. Specifically, I present indications that within approximations, demanding that quantum gravity solves the Landau-pole problems in Abelian gauge couplings and Yukawa couplings strongly constrain the viable gravitational parameter space.
