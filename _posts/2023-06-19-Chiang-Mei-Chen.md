In this talk, I will discuss the quantum improvement of black hole solutions in the context of asymptotic safety. We propose that the consistency of the first law of thermodynamics is the principle that should determine physically sensible scale identification, at least close to the horizon. The quantum effect provides a repulsive force in the core region near singularity which stabilizes the thermodynamically unstable small black holes. It also creates a zero temperature state with finite size which could be a candidate for dark matter. Moreover, there is a new second order phase transition between small and large black holes for quantum improved Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter black holes. We also discuss the black holes with different spatial topologies and find a notable duality.
