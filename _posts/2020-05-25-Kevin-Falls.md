title: "Kevin Falls: Background independent exact renormalisation"
---

I will discuss a new flow equation for the Wilsonian effective action based on a gauge invariant UV regularisation of gauge theories and gravity. The regularisation consists of a combination of covariant higher derivative terms in the action and determinants of Pauli-Villars operators in the path integral measure. This approach has the advantages that no background field is introduced and the action remains gauge invariant along the flow without needing to fix a gauge. The seminar will be based on the recent paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11409.
