In this work, we study long-range interactions in non-gravitational field theories and their behaviour in the deep infrared. To model such effects, we consider a nonlocal scalar theory obtained by adding a 
ϕ□−1ϕ
ϕ□
−1
ϕ term to the local action. Using the functional renormalisation group, we analyse its infrared fixed-point structure.

Within the local potential approximation (LPA), we show that nonlocality modifies phase-transition patterns and can induce symmetry breaking. Extending the LPA beyond polynomial truncations, we examine the convexity property of the effective potential as 
k→0
k→0 and find that the flow becomes singular for 
λ2>0
λ
2
>0 before reaching the deep infrared.

In the LPA′ framework, we find that the infrared-stable fixed point is the nonlocal Gaussian fixed point. We then generalise the model to 
ϕ□σ/2ϕ
ϕ□
σ/2
ϕ and analyse how the infrared properties depend on 
σ
σ. With appropriate scaling choices, we show that the infrared behaviour remains unchanged up to 
σ=d/2
σ=d/2 and follows Sak’s prediction up to 
σ=2
σ=2.

Finally, we study higher-derivative cases within the LPA, focusing on 
σ=4
σ=4, which corresponds to isotropic Lifshitz criticality, and obtain results consistent with earlier work.
