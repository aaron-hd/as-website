For more than a decade, we are used to the idea that evaluating Wetterich’s equation for polynomial f(R)-truncations yields 3 relevant directions. Moreover, the new directions opening up when increasing the order of the approximation become more and more irrelevant and essentially follow a canonical scaling behavior. The recent publication arXiv:2402.01075 challenges this (admittedly very desirable) feature based on investigations building on the composite operator formalism. In this talk, I will summarize my understanding of why the two approaches give vastly different results. I will also give a personal account of the structural features which require a more profound understanding in relation to these findings. The talk will be rather concise leaving room for discussion afterwards.
