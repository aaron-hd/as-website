from quantum gravity"

Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through
dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions.
Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings
by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planckscale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum
gravity. In this talk I will present how we took a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings
that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in
asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity
regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.
This adds to existing studies of the relevancy of dimension-five operators in asymptotic safety, to which we compare our results.
