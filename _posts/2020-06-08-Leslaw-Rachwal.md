title: "Leslaw Rachwal: Effective action from FRG"
---

We study the quantum gravitational system coupled to a charged scalar, Dirac fermions, and electromagnetic fields. We use the "exact" or "functional" renormalization group equation to derive the effective action \Gamma_0 by integrating the flow equation from the ultraviolet scale (where we specify some initial condition for the flow) down to energy scale k = 0. The resulting effective action consists of local terms and nonlocal terms with unique coefficients.
