I will discuss how regular black hole spacetimes are obtained from an effective Lagrangian for Quantum Einstein Gravity. The interior matter is modeled as a dust fluid, which interacts with the geometry through a multiplicative coupling function. The specific form of this free function is deduced from Asymptotically Safe gravity, under the key assumption that the Reuter fixed point remains minimally affected by the presence of matter. As a consequence the gravitational coupling vanishes at high energies. The static exterior geometry of the black hole is entirely determined by the junction conditions at the boundary surface. Consequently, the resulting global spacetime geometry remains devoid of singularities at all times. This outcome offers a new perspective on how regular black holes are formed via gravitational collapse.
