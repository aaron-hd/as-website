In this talk, I will explore the phenomenological consequences of Quantum Scale symmetry in the matter sector of the Standard Model with Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity. In particular, trans-Planckian quantum scale symmetry in the matter sector induced by Asymptotically Safe Quantum Gravity, leaves an imprint on some of the Standard Model parameters, namely the CKM mixing elements. We provide a scenario where the apparent near-diagonal structure of the CKM matrix is naturally explained through RG flows toward fixed lines in the CKM sector. Ultimately, this mechanism manifests itself in the experimental data and specifically in the decay rates of various B-mesons. Similar considerations would also hold for the lepton sector leading to a near-diagonal structure of the lepton mixing matrix. We can avoid such an outcome by setting the neutrino mass scale to be sufficiently small and we provide a qualitative upper bound on the neutrino mass scale.
