intro: 
  - excerpt: 'The international seminar on asymptotic safety was founded in spring 2011, with the intention of bringing the asymptotic-safety community together, and providing a platform for talks on asymptotic safety in and beyond quantum gravity, as well as related topics in quantum gravity and quantum field theory.
If you are interested in attending the seminars, please contact one of the three organizers (link to organizers) to join the corresponding mailing list.'
