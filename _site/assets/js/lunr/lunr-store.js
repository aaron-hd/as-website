        "excerpt":"In this talk I will present the analysis of a dually-weighted Matrix Model which implements a preferred foliation in its dual-graph. By using the FRGE, we study the existence of fixed points and its universality class (CDT or Euclidean Matrix Models). We find first evidence that the FGRE is a...","categories": [],

These area variables are however, not free but satisfy certain constraints which allow for a consistent gluing. I will introduce a family of ‘effective’ spin foam models that incorporate...","categories": [],
